# Advanced Filename Formatter

A dynamic extension of OBS Studio's filename formatting.


## Installation and usage

- Read [the doc](https://github.com/Penwy/adv-ff/blob/main/docs/doc.md)
- No, seriously, read it.
- Replay buffer functionalities are not available on vanilla OBS, until PR #8955 gets merged (A custom build with those functionalities can be found [here](https://github.com/Penwy/obs-studio/actions/runs/7074380931)).
- Ensure your OBS install uses python >= 3.9. Behaviour isn't guaranteed on earlier versions of python.
- Download adv-ff.py and add it to OBS.

I should generally be available on the official OBS support server, under the name Penwywern, if you have issues.
