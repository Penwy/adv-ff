# Advanced Filename Formatter

A dynamic extension of OBS Studio's filename formatting.


## Installation and usage

- Read [the doc](https://github.com/Penwy/adv-ff/blob/main/docs/doc.md)
- No, seriously, read it.
- If you want full functionality (replay buffer and hooked data), grab this [custom build](https://github.com/Penwy/obs-studio/actions/runs/5301025505), or compile yourself from [this branch](https://github.com/Penwy/obs-studio/tree/adv-ff-tester).
- Ensure your OBS install uses python >= 3.9. Behaviour isn't guaranteed on earlier versions of python.
- Download adv-ff.py and add it to OBS.

I should generally be available on the official OBS support server, under the name Penwywern, if you have issues.
